    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These cookies look just like little hamburgers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 drops green food coloring</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon water</li>
      <li>48 vanilla wafers</li>
      <li>24 chocolate covered thin mints</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine food coloring with a few drops of water. Add coconut
        and cover the container, shake until coconut is tinted. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/2 of the vanilla wafers, flat side up, in an ungreased cookie
        sheet. Top each wafer with a peppermint patty. Place in the oven about 1
        minute or just until chocolate begins to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cookies from oven and sprinkle each mint with 1/2 teaspoon
        coconut (for lettuce). Place another vanilla wafer on top and press
        gentle. With a clean paint brush, brush the top of each hamburger with
        just enough water to moisten so that the sesame seeds will stick when
        sprinkled on top of each cookie. NOTE: You can use canned chocolate
        frosting in place of peppermint patty, then eliminate the baking.
